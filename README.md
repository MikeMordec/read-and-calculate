Read and Calculate
Description

This C++ program reads data from a file, performs calculations, and writes the results to an output file. It serves as a demonstration of basic file handling and arithmetic operations in C++.
Features

    Reads input data from a file.
    Performs calculations based on the input data.
    Writes the results to an output file.
    Demonstrates proper error handling for file operations.

Usage

    Clone the repository to your local machine.
    Compile the Lab1_PE_3_5.cpp file using a C++ compiler.
    Run the compiled executable, providing the input file name when prompted.
    The program will process the input file, perform calculations, and generate an output file named Ch3_Ex5Output.dat.

Example

Suppose you have an input file named input.txt with the following content:

Doe John 50000 5
Smith Alice 60000 7

Running the program with input.txt as input will generate an output file Ch3_Ex5Output.dat with the following content:

John Doe 52500.00
Alice Smith 64200.00
